Anonymous CVS login

In order to make anonymous CVS access easier, you should set your CVSROOT environment variable to

:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.lyx.org:/usr/local/lyx/cvsroot

(Alternatively, you can use the -d option to the cvs commands.).

Now just do:

cvs login

The password is lyx. Finally,

cvs checkout lyx-devel

This will make a directory lyx-devel and download lots of files into that directory. Of course you can say cvs checkout lyx-1_0_x instead, depending on which module you'd like to download.
